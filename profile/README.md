# Take The Password Test

Creating strong passwords is crucial to protecting your online accounts from hackers and breaches. Here are some helpful tips and tricks to enhance your password strength. You can also use tools like **Password Strength Checker** to assess your current password security.

## 1. Use a Combination of Characters
Include **uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters** (like `@`, `#`, `%`, etc.) in your password. The more varied the characters, the stronger your password.

## 2. [Avoid Common Words and Phrases](https://passwordstrengthchecker.pro/)
Avoid using **dictionary words, names, or common phrases** like `password123`. Hackers can easily guess these using brute force attacks.

## 3. Longer Passwords Are Better
Aim for at least **12-16 characters**. Longer passwords exponentially increase the time it would take to crack them.

## 4. Don’t Reuse Passwords
Never use the **same password** across multiple sites. If one account gets compromised, all others could be at risk.

## 5. [Use a Password Manager](https://passwordstrengthchecker.pro/)
**Password managers** can generate and store complex passwords, so you don’t have to remember them all. This also reduces the temptation to use weaker passwords.

## 6. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Whenever possible, enable **2FA**. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of identification (like a code sent to your phone).

## 7. Avoid Personal Information
Don’t include easily guessable information like **your name, birthdate, or pet’s name**. These are often easy for attackers to find through social media.
